Python Collections
---------------------
1.List is a collection which is ordered and changeable.Allow duplicate members.
2.Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
3.Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
4.Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

Ordered:
-----------
1.It means lists are in defined order and that order will not change.
2.If you add new items to a list they will be placed at the end.
Changeable:
-----------
1.The changeable means that wwe can change,add and remove items in a list after it has been created.
Inbuilt Methods:
------------------

Lists:
---------------------
1.append -which is used to insert the value/any in the end of the list.
2.insert - which is used to insert any value in the wanted index position.
3.pop - which is used to remove the item in list which is at last index
4.remove - which is used to remove the given value of it's first occurance in that list.
5.del : it is a statement to delete the items in a list in a given range.
6.clear : If we want to clear/remove all the objects present in the list.
7.count : It is used to count how many occurances are there.


Stacks: LIFO(Last in First Out)
------
Queues: FIFO(First In First Out)
-------

Tuples :
-------
1.count() - It Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple.
2.index() - It Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

Sets :
-------
1.add() - It adds the value to the end
2.remove() - It removes the specified element
3.clear() - Clear the entire sets.
4.pop() - It removes the element from set(FIFO)
5.union() - | - Return a set containing the union of sets
6.difference() - -  Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
7.intersection() - & - Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
8.symmetric_difference() - ^ - Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets


Dictionaries :
----------------
1.get() - returns the value of a specified key


Classes :
-----------
    Constructor:
    -------------
        1.It is a special method in a class and that is present in every class.
            Name :- __init__() ->Magical method
    Magic Methods :
    ----------------
    1.Magical methods are present in every class by default.
        i.__init__() - It is a constructor type and it is called whenever class is initiated.
        ii.__str__() - It controls what should be returned when the object is represented as a string.
        iii.__eq__(self,other) - It compare two objects, if they are equal returns true otherwise false.
            Note: The ( == ) operator compares the references(addresses) of the objects.
        iv.__gt__(self,other) - It is used to compare b/w 2 objects and return the true if greater or else false.
        v.__add__(self,other) - It is used to add the two object values and return the result
